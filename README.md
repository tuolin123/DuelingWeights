# Dueling_weights

This is R code for generating all the results in the manuscript entitled "On Frequency and Probability Weights: An In-depth Look at Dueling Weights". In "Weights_code.R", there are two parts of analysis. The first is for NHANES 2013-2014 data analysis (this is a public dataset that could be found online) to demonstrate the statistical considerations of sampling weights, more details can be found in Section 4.1. The second is for Lalonde data analysis for propensity score weights, as discussed in Section 4.2.

All the analyses are performed with R 4.2.2.
